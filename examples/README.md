This folder contains a worked example of the **Research Audit Protocol (ChatGPT–Gemini Duel), v1.7**.

**Task used in the example**

> I need a deep, high-quality analysis of the following topic:  
> **HOW CAN I IMPROVE THE PROPOSED WAIVE APPROACH?**  
> I am attaching the following materials:  
> `maive.pdf` (existing paper, background)  
> `waive_ottawa.pdf` (presentation of the concept of WAIVE)

**Files**

- `maive.pdf` -- MAIVE paper used as background.
- `waive_ottawa.pdf` -- WAIVE Ottawa presentation slides.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
